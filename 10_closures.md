1. Function bundled with lexical scope is called closure.
2. Even if we return the function, it still remembers its original lexical environment and local storage so it can access values.
3. If we write return function x(){.....} --- this automatically returns the value.
4. The function that is returned is reference so any change in value of that variable inside function will be reflected as such.
